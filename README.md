About the project
 An ESP32 and Arduino-powered Samrt Plug model, using Blynk software that observes the energy 
usage as it happens. It monitors in real-time, giving instant information how much energy is 
being used. This model is designed to be user-friendly, allowing the users to track the 
energy consumption of each appliance, showing the information using an their prefered device
where the data is transmitted from Blynk software allowing the User to have Remote Control over their device. 

üîç What It Does:
-Live Power Usage Tracking: Get instant insights into how much juice your devices are consuming.
- Blynk App Sync: Stay connected and monitor power usage from your phone or laptop, anytime, anywhere.
- Powered by ESP32: Leveraging the versatile ESP32 microcontroller for seamless connectivity and performance.
- Precision Hardware: Featuring a current sensor and a single-channel relay module for accurate measurements and control.
- Smart Conversion: An AC to DC converter powers the system efficiently from any standard outlet.
- Calibration : Calibrated usage reading to showcase an accurate reading for the user.
- User Friendly: Allowing control of their Connected Devices remotely through their prefered Device using Blynk Application.
